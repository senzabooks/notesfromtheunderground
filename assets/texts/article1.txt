In the beginning of November 24 I reached out to a friend of a friend, Eddy Rakovic, for some film recommendations. Specifically, films in which type plays an important role. In a way that it would be somehow weaved into the image not stand next to it.(1)   
Eddy gave me a short introduction on two films: Zorn’s Lemma (1970)  by Hollis Frampton and Drowning by Numbers (1988) by Peter Greenway.

I watched the films and tried to find what is common for them. Both are based on a clear sequence that creates the structure. And it is the sequential ordering that plays the most important role. The visual form is not important or even completely ignored.
	








Structure 

On the 27th of October 2024, in Eye Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, there was a screening of a Hollis Frampton’s Zorn’s Lemma. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorns_Lemma It was a part of a bigger film programme and exhibition, UNDERGROUND, American Avant-Garde Film in the 1960s. I haven’t seen the exhibition nor have I attended the  screening, I found out about it, a month later through Eddy Rakovic, a friend of a friend, whom I asked for some film recommendations. 
In both cases the structure is introduced in full at the beginning of the film.
